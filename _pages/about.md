Hey everyone! I am a graduate student at ETH Zürich pursuing an MSc degree in Computational Science and Engineering (specializing in Fluid Dynamics). My broad research interests are Scientific Machine Learning and Scientific Computing. I also work as a Research Assistant at the [CAPS Lab](https://caps.ethz.ch/) at D-MAVT ETH Zürich.

Prior to graduate school, I completed my Bachelors in Chemical Engineering at BITS Pilani, India and worked as an undergraduate research intern at the [Lu Group](https://lugroup.yale.edu/) (previously at University of Pennsylvania).
