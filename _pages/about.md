Hey everyone! I am a graduate student at ETH Zürich pursuing an MSc degree in Computational Science and Engineering (specializing in Fluid Dynamics). My broad research interests are Scientific Machine Learning and Scientific Computing. 

Prior to graduate school, I completed my Bachelors in Chemical Engineering at BITS Pilani, India and worked as an undergraduate research intern at the Lu Group (University of Pennsylvania).
